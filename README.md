## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Verilog HDL designs and testbenches for a wide range of digital circuits. It covers number conversions, combinational circuits, sequential circuits, logic gates, and operators. Each design is accompanied by a testbench to simulate and verify its functionality.

These projects are ideal for beginners and intermediate students learning digital design, Verilog HDL, and hardware simulation. By studying these designs, users can understand circuit behavior, timing analysis, and digital logic concepts practically.

## Features

Number Conversions:
Designs for converting between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal number systems, demonstrating fundamental data representation in digital systems.

## Combinational Circuits:
Includes adders, subtractors, multiplexers, and decoders. These circuits perform operations that depend only on the current inputs, helping users understand logic optimization and Boolean algebra.

##  Sequential Circuits:
Includes counters, shift registers, and flip-flops. These circuits store state information and operate based on clock signals, helping users learn about timing, synchronization, and state machines.

## Logic Gates:
Implementations of basic gates like AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. Users can explore gate-level logic and combinations to build more complex circuits.

## Operators in Verilog:
Demonstrates the use of arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators for performing calculations, comparisons, and logical operations in digital design.

## Testbenches:
Each design has a corresponding testbench to simulate its behavior. Testbenches generate inputs, monitor outputs, and provide waveform visualization to verify correctness.
